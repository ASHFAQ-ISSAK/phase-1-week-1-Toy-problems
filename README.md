# phase-1-week-1-Toy-problems

in this project we tackle three problems
-student grade generator
-speed detector
-salary calculator
each solutions is written in itws own javascript file and runs on the terminal using node js

student grade generator
Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. and the output will match a correct grade, as shown below:
A > 79,
B - 60 to 79,
C - 59 to 49,
D - 40 to 49,
E - less 40.

speed detector
This is a program that prompts the user to input a given speed,
the speed is then checked if it greater than 70 ,if greater than 70
the program returns the ammount of demerit poinsts the driver accumulates per 5km above the speed limit

salary calculator
This is a file that contains three programs within it:

    A |
    This is a function that calculate the netsalary by asking the user for their basic  salary and benefits

    B |
    This is a function that Calculate the taxrate for the user by asking the user for the grosssalary

    C |
    This is a function that calculate the Nhif deductibles by comparing the grosspay to the rate of deductibles defined in an if statment
